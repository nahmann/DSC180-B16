            Steps
            <br>
            1. The users are all physically at UCSD and have been physically near each other.
            One person, in this case Kat, decides to spoof/change their location on their phone with a VPN.
            As a result, Kat's phone is no longer declaring that it is in UCSD. All the other users are 
            still declaring their location to be at UCSD. As a result, the phones of Alice, Bob, Daniel, and Emily 
            all detect Kat's phone as being different and record her phone's ID. Kat's phone in return record 
            the ids of the others since their location is different from itself.
            <br>
            2. After an hour, the phones will send the IDs they have collected to the server. 
            <br>
            3. The server runs an a trust algorithm to determine whose phone was lying about it's 
            location. The algorithm we use was a majority voting system. In this example, Kat's 
            phone has the most votes and is identified as the liar.
            <br>
            4. Kat's phone ID is then stored in a blocklist after being identified as the person who 
            lied about their location.

        Project Info
      </h3>

      <p>
        Many applications make use of location data in order to provide their 
        services, but malicious users can disrupt these by manipulating or 
        faking their location. In an effort to combat and catch these users, 
        our project involves a system to authenticate user location data without 
        having one central authority in control of all the information. By 
        leveraging the physical proximity necessary for devices to send and 
        receive data through Bluetooth Low Energy signals, our system is able 
        to detect users lying about their location without receiving any location 
        information. Our portion of the project was creating the server backend 
        that communicates with devices to store information about flagged users 
        and process it for the purpose of adding malicious users to a blacklist.

        More technical details can be found in our report. You can find the link 
        for the report on the side navigation

        About us
      </h3>

      <p>
        Hello, and thanks for taking an interest in our project. This site was part of our 
        Data Science 180 Capstone project that we worked on for 2 quarters under a mentor. 
        The first quarter consisted of recreating results, exploring a domain, and proposing 
        a project that would then be completed in the second quarter. We were one of 66 
        project groups in the 2022-2023 iteration of the class. A full list of all the 
        teams can be found on the HDSI showcase website (https://hdsishowcase.com/). 
  
        <br>
  
        Our project is unique in that it consists of 2 teams under the same mentor: 
        one for the app (Group B16-2) and one for the server (Group B16-2). We are 
        the server-side team and consist of 4 members: Nathan Ahmann, Mason Chan, 
        Alex Guan, and Alan Miyazaki. Our mentor was Haojian Jin. Over the course 
        of this quarter, we developed a backend server (on this website) and successfully 
        linked it to the Android devices running the app team's code. Together these create a fully functioning system

        FAQ
      </h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          What is decentralized location consensus?
        </li>
        
      </ul>
      <p>
        Decentralized Location Consensus means verifying users are at the 
        location they claim to be. The decentralized part is saying that not 
        all of the data should be stored in one place which helps protect 
        privacy. The location consensus is that devices should reach a consensus 
        of who is being truthful about their location.
