    <h1> DSC 180A - Decentralized Location Consensus Through Proximity Tracing</h1>
    <p>Welcome to our DSC 180A project backend!</p>

    <h3>
      What is our project about?
    </h3>
    <p style = "width:80%; margin: auto;">
      The project focuses on the legitimacy of mobile device locations, 
      without compromising the privacy of its user. Several popular mobile 
      applications revolve around proximity to other devices, such as games 
      like Pokemon Go or dating apps like Tinder, Bumble, or Hinge. However, 
      it can be rather easy for people to spoof or alter their location data 
      for the sake of misleading these applications. In an effort to combat 
      and catch potentially malicious users, our project involves a system 
      to authenticate user location data without having one central authority 
      in control of all the information. By leveraging the physical proximity 
      necessary for devices to send and receive data through Bluetooth Low 
      Energy signals, our system is able to detect users lying about their 
      location without receiving any location information. Our portion of the 
      project was creating the server backend that communicates with devices 
      to store information about flagged users and process it for the purpose 
      of adding malicious users to a blacklist.

      Our Team
    </h4>
    <p>
      As the server team, our job is to recieve IDs that the phones 
      send and populate a black list to relay who is untrustworthy. We do this
      by considering the majority rule of BLE signals to authenticate the location
      of detected users.
